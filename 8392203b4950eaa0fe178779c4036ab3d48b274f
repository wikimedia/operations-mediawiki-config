Presumably if for some reason Etcd is unavailable for a short period of time, we should assume ReadOnly mode, right? Or does it not matter given that we still have MySQL as last layer of defence, which also has a read-only mode enforced that MediaWiki will find out about and cache accordingly (todo: Double-check that we a short-lived cache in APC or Memc for if mysql responds with read-only.)",
