This way it\u0027s the same as the ip/newbie limit, but with the allowance to burst (e.g. you can make more than 8 edits per minute, up to 80, but the system requires a grace period of 9 minutes after that).\n\nThough even then 80 seems a bit low. Remember that this only applies to autoconfirmed users. For \u0027newbie\u0027 we have a separate rule.",
