      "message": "Aye, good point. \n\nThere was an effort at some point to rename wmg* to wgWMF* to reduce confusion. Would be good to pick that up again (T45956).\n\nThe current names are too similar, but they do need to remain separate, though.  \n\nThe \u0027wg*\u0027 vars are settings for MediaWiki (either core, or an extension). Such setting presumably has a default within MediaWiki, and is also used by MediaWiki.\n\nThe \u0027wmg*\u0027 vars, on the other hand, are purely for communication within wmf-config. In this case, the wmgUseNavigationTiming is set here, and then consumed by CommonSettings.php. It\u0027s not used elsewhere.",
