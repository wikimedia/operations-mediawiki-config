      "message": "I think that removing *any* upload link is an obvious configuration oversight, some upload link for some users must be available. AFAICS:\n* The is* wikis were requested in bulk and at least one of them has an upload link, probably the others didn\u0027t have the equivalent target and were forgotten.\n* For guwikisource the current config is completely wrong, they asked upload disabled but it was only for \"user\" so \"autoconfirmed\" can upload since the global default changed, and they have a lock hack to override this. The navigation url is another oversight.\n* Meta... I don\u0027t remember, but I agree on removing it from this patch because it was a recent config change. I think I thought for a moment that $wgUploadNavigationUrl would only take effect for those without upload permission.",
