      "message": "That is a good start. While at it I would enhance the test to be more strict:\n\n\u0027from\u0027 and \u0027to\u0027 are both required. They should be valid for strtotime().\n\nSetting \u0027ip\u0027 will bypass \u0027range\u0027. I guess they should be mutually exclusive, eg ensure that only one of each is set.\n\nWhen \u0027value\u0027 is set, it must be is_numeric() else that fallback to the default value of 50.\n\nFood for later: \u0027IP\u0027 should really be always lower case \u0027ip\u0027.  Will need to update the comment and the fallback code that accommodate for both lower/uper cases.",
