      "message": "One non-obvious part of a section config is that the 0-indexed entry is the read-write connection and all the following entries are read-only connections. If we put the db2037 host in the eqiad config then it would be used for all read-only connections by default which is not a good outcome.\n\nI\u0027m not sure about the safety of treating db2037 as primary even when serving from codfw as it would imply master-master sync or at least controlled failover back to eqiad. That may be a bad assumption however which would mean that we should remove db1073 here.",
