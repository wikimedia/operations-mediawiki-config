      "message": "would it be possible to rename this search-khi? Mostly for consistency purposes. I know we can\u0027t change the underlying elasticsearch cluster name for deployment reasons, but perhaps this can be? I suppose to be extra careful we could first deploy a version with search and search-khi, then deploy a second that removed search. Not sure if it would be necessary",

      "message": "Doing it like this might make it harder to load data into the clusters.\n\nBasically when we first create and populate the indices in these new clusters cirrus will need to have DefaultCluster set to the large cluster, and CirrusSearchClusters will need to contain both the current large cluster, and the new psi/omega roundrobin.\n\nI had originally been pondering this a bit in https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T205558#4660396",
