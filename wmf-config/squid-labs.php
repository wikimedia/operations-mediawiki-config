# our text squid in beta labs gets forwarded requests

# will be stripped; purge requests should get to it
# on the address in the SquidServers list

# The beta cluster does not have multicast, hence we route the purge
# requests directly to the varnish instances.  They have varnishhtcpd listening
# on UDP port 4827.
