# our text squid in beta labs gets forwarded requests
# from the ssl terminator, to 127.0.0.1, so adding that
# address to the NoPurge list so that XFF headers for it
# will be stripped; purge requests should get to it
# on the address in the SquidServers list

# The beta cluster does not have multicast, hence we route the purge
# requests directly to the varnish instances.  They have varnishhtcpd listening
# on UDP port 4827.
