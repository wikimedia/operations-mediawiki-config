There are some problems with PDF rendering anyway, then we shifted to ElectronPDF, that also had problems, now we\u0027re shifting to Proton (chromium-render). This code needs some clean-up anyway.\n\nWe have a patch to fix it properly, for now we want to disable the rdf2latex render, disable button, get Proton deployed, and then we will clean up this mess.",
