      "message": "I think it’s a bit confusing to have this in the middle of the larger clientDbList block – would probably be better to have a separate block for this, even if it means repeating the `if ( $wgDBname \u003d\u003d\u003d \u0027testwikidatawiki\u0027 )` condition. (Or you could introduce a $wmgWBRepoEnableRefTabs setting, unconditionally set $wgWBRepoSettings[\u0027enableRefTabs\u0027] \u003d $wmgWBRepoEnableRefTabs in this file, and then set wmgWBRepoEnableRefTabs in InitializeSettings.php for the different wikis – that seems to be how a lot of the other settings are set too, see below.)",
