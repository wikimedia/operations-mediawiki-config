      "message": "This suggests \u0027level\u0027 is ignored for Logstash, and is instead hardcoded to \u0027info\u0027 for this shortcut format. Is that true?\n\nSee *ref in the other file, which would also need updating if that\u0027s the case. Can you point to where that logic is? And what would do you think about changing that to reflect the previous docs instead?\n\nWhen it comes to managing the volume, I think it\u0027s quite important that setting this to \u0027warn\u0027 for example, does not send lower severities to Logstash either. In fact, if we are going to have a rounding down where one is less sensitive, Logstash should be the one more sensitive not less, given that\u0027s where we\u0027ve felt the most pressure.",

      "message": "The exclusion of debug from Logstash is not about privacy. It has historically been about the physical storage capacity of the backing Elasticsearch cluster and the ability of our ELK stack to keep up with the inbound log event volume. This probably should be re-examined once the ELK cluster has been updated fully.",

      "message": "My \"less sensitive\" was a reference to how sensitive a backend is to capacity problems.\n\nI mentioned that Logstash is indeed the more sensitive one in this regard (compared to mwlog/udp2log).\n\nAnd if the code ignores this level (both when it is lower than \u0027warn\u0027 as well as when it is higher than \u0027warn\u0027) that would cause unexpected impact when attempting to limit data flow by raising the minimum log severity for a channel, if it still sends the same to Logstash.\n\nAnyhow, afaik, this isn\u0027t true. We have \u0027debug\u0027 ones listed here that do get (and should) be sent to Logstash, and ones with higher cut offs that aren\u0027t sent below that. At least, it worked sometime last October when I last fiddled with it.\n\nIf and when they should differ, that should be explicit, right?",
