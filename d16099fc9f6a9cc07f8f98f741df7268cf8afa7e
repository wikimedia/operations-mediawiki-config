      "message": "ip-all means a per-IP limit for all users; ip means a per-IP limit for anonymous or new users. Both are problems for an editathon or such, where a large number of new people register and start editing on the same network. The limit could simply be removed but for some reason throttle-analyze.php just changes the other limits to some very high value so it\u0027s probably more consistent to follow that.",
