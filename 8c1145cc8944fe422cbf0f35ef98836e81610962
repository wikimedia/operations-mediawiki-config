Value \u0027false\u0027 is allowed in DefaultSettings.php, but Setup.php casts that to \"$IP/images\" - which is presumably what will happen here as well (or it will cause run-time failures operating on bool-not-string or unexpected string \"false\").\n\nThere are also various derivative configuration values such as $wgReadOnlyFile and $wgDeletedDirectory.\n\nAre we sure this variable in general is not used anywhere in wmf-production runtime of mediawiki?",
