      "message": "Yes, production servers are looking for the unused filename. I considered fixing it as part of the ReadOnlyMode refactor, but the motivation left me as I considered the various trade-offs between preserving stupid Lee-isms (you know the \"yBgMBwiR\" part is a secret key, right?), breaking backwards compatibility, or having hackish secret features like $wgReadOnlyFile\u003dnull means don\u0027t check the file. HHVM has a stat cache, right?\n\nThese variables were here in InitialiseSettings.php so that people could find them and change them easily. But we\u0027re not recommending that people do it that way anymore.",
