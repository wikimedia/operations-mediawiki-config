Assigning a variable (as opposed to extending, or adding to) declare the full value in one place, which means any previous value is unset.\n\nTo avoid complexity from extending variable, we therefore set a variable either only in IS.php or CS.php.\n\nThis would be a good reason to have a test that automatically verifies a variable isn\u0027t set in both.",
