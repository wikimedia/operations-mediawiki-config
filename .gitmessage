# When in doubt, consult https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/Commit_message_guidelines
#
# - Subject should be 50 characters or less
# - Separate body from subject
# - Use imperative mood, avoid passive voice
# - Wrap the body text at 72 chars
#
# Explain "why" and "what". If it does not make sense to include
# this in your commit message, then delete those sections.
#
# Don't forget the Bug: line
# Don't leave a blank line after the Bug: line
#
# If you are unsure about what to use for component:
#  - "HookContainer" could work for changes to include/HookContainer
#  - "phpunit" for changes to PHPUnit tests
#  - "Authentication" for changes affecting multiple sections
#     relating to user authentication
#
# Hint: you can enable this to be used as a template for git commit
# git config commit.template .gitmessage
