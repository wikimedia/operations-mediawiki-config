      "message": "The MediaWiki prefix would still exist. This would just keep our stuff separate from any other MW install that happened to point at labmon1001.eqiad.wmnet. Stats would become beta-cluster.MediaWiki.foo.bar.baz. If we don\u0027t do that then the data *might* get pollution from other traffic sources that can hit that server (all of Labs)",
