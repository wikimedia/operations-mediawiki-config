      "message": "The MediaWiki prefix would still exist. This would just keep our stuff separate from any other MW install that happened to point at labmon1001.eqiad.wmnet. Stats would become beta-cluster.MediaWiki.foo.bar.baz. If we don\u0027t do that then the data *might* get pollution from other traffic sources that can hit that server (all of Labs)",

That\u0027s distinctive enough and doesn\u0027t force you to read through a list of several hundred project names. I imagine this would what developers looking at graphite on labmon1001 would most frequently be after, and beta-cluster is not easily guessable (it could be under deployment-prep, or mediawiki, or who knows what) and forces you to read through the list while anything that starts with a capital letter gets to the top of the list and stands out.",
