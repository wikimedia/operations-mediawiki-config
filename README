-------------------------------

Files in this repository are almost a mirror of the Wikimedia Foundation
cluster configuration. Omitted files include passwords and security measures.

dblists/
 List of wiki databases.
 For labs-only dblists, add "-labs" suffix before the file extension.
 If you add a new wiki, make the files are sorted using `LC_COLLATE=C sort -n file -o file`.

errorpages/
 Central management of error pages used by app servers at the PHP or Apache level.

wikiversions.json, wikiversions.php
wikiversions-labs.json, wikiversions-labs.php
 Let us associate a database with a specific copy of MediaWiki (generally a
 branch). The .php file is updated by editing wikiversions.json first and then
 running multiversion/updateWikiversions.

debug.json
 Configuration for X-Wikimedia-Debug. The browser extensions use this to
 determine which app servers are available to use as X-Wikimedia-Debug
 backends. See <https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/X-Wikimedia-Debug>.

docroot/
 The Apache document roots for most of our VirtualHosts.

static/
 Static files available under all docroots as /static.
 Contains icons and images used by MediaWiki, such as project logos,
 favicons, CentralAuth SUL icons and more.

images/
 Deprecated aliases for a subset of files in /static/images.

w/
 The "w/" directory in the docroot of any MediaWiki-serving VirtualHost.

tests/
 Hold some PHPUnit tests.

wmf-config/
 The MediaWiki configuration for all database.
 Think of it like a huge LocalSettings.php.

wmf-config/CommonSettings.php
 Generic configuration such as including extensions or calling over piece
 of configuration. This is mostly shared among all wikis.

wmf-config/InitialiseSettings.php
 Per-wiki configuration.

wmf-config/db-*.php
 Databases related configuration.

wmf-config/mc.php
 Memcached configuration.

wmf-config/*-labs.php
