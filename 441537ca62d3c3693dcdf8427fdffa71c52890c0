      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I understand the purpose of $sources. Are these supposed to resolve to production wikis, importing from beta wikis?\n\nBecause we don\u0027t have beta wikis for Wikimania etc.\n\nIf that is the case, then the commit subject is misleading – which suggests we enable importing to/from any beta cluster project. But rather, this is enabling import from any production cluster wiki, on any beta cluster wiki. Correct?\n\nBut then below it uses local database (which is beta in beta), to fill the rest of the array. So how does it distinguish?",

      "message": "This configuration is actually intended for production, but Alex wisely suggested that it be tested on the beta cluster first. If it works on beta, then it can be enabled on production. \n\nI don\u0027t think there is any point creating a specific import setup for labs, as it is just a test environment. The production config should work on labs, but it will include a lot of wikis that don\u0027t exist there (as you point out). For example, on labs, wm20** resolves to the actual Wikimania domains in production. But that\u0027s not a problem.\n\nI think the problem really is that the commit message is incorrect. I\u0027ll try to improve it.",
