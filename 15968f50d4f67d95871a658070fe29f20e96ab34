That\u0027s why I\u0027m not using it since we can work easier without having to change the config once ORES is moved to prod (ores.wikimedia.org) (probably won\u0027t affect anything however since it\u0027ll be probably just a redirect but we can save that too)",

When later that is redirected to production, it means the beta cluster will use the production service which might be misleading and causing noise in production.\n\nI believe we should setup a development/staging ORES service on beta cluster, so we would point the variable to something like http://ores.beta.wmflabs.org/  .
