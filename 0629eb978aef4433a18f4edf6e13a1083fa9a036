      "message": "This term is unfamiliar to me. Was this meant to be \"interface-admin\"?\n\nAlso, assuming that this only applies to settings from wmf-config (in that, extensions can still override it, as well as global groups), perhaps it would be more suitable as a structure test on the repository, that way we can fail the build, instead of silently removing it at run-time, which may be confusing.\n\nAlternatively, we could keep it here with a warning, which means scap will get it and prevent deployment, but a unit test might be cleaner/less risky.",

I suppose it would have to require CommonSettings.php, which sounds a bit scary.\n\nA more robust approach would be to use a hook such as UserGetRights, although that probably does interfere with global groups so it\u0027s more effort to maintain.",
