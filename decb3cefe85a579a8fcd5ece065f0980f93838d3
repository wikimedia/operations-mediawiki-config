      "message": "The \u0027userAgent\u0027 field should be redundant. I couldn\u0027t quite tell for user whether the code tolerates its absence, but I think it does, especially given the default value is false instead of empty array, or nested empty arrays. And indeed it supports it according to the added test at https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/416627/ - although I did notice some other unexpected behaviour in that new test. Could use some eyes on that.\n\nFor wmf-config, while I\u0027m sure things are fine, as a general practice we should enable things in Beta Cluster and/or test wikis before going to all wikis.\n\nI suggest placing this in InitialiseSettings.php with \u0027default\u0027 \u003d\u003e false, and \u0027testwiki\u0027 set to this array. Then, to apply to all wikis, we change the key \u0027testwiki\u0027 to \u0027default\u0027, and remove the default entry.\n\nThe test doesn\u0027t have to be long, could just be an hour or day.\n\nMaintaining settings in InitialiseSettings.php is generally preferred, although it\u0027s understandable you started here given the existing (bad) example. Sorry :)",

      "message": "I\u0027ll check on the test that you added to see what the deal is.  \n\nThe \u0027userAgent\u0027 field isn\u0027t strictly necessary, there are existence checks everywhere that it\u0027s referenced in the code.  I added it as an empty array because that\u0027s generally best practice for configuration (as opposed to having it missing from the config but populated by a default that comes from elsewhere).\n\nI\u0027ll move to InitialiseSettings.php in the morning.  Presumably the rest of these settings should also move there?",
