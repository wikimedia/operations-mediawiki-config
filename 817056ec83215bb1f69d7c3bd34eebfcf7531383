      "message": "vote.wikimedia.org is a fairly rarely used wiki. I\u0027m not sure why we should add it unless we also add the dozens of other private/special wikis that are currently not listed here.\n\nGiven that this configuration variable is primarily an optimisation, I\u0027d prefer we limit it to regular and public wikis.\n\nEspecially a sensitive vote.wikimedia.org is imho not worth the risk to add an optimisation like this for. I can imagine it being abused in someway by relying on routing for a subrequest to go to the same localhost. It\u0027s extra information an attacker could rely on that just isn\u0027t worth it.",
