      "message": "I don\u0027t see code for --rebase anywhere. Also, what would this mean? A cherry-pick always effectively rebases it on the tip of the target branch.\n\nOr is this to rebase an existing cherry-pick? By default, when cherry-picking something from master that was already cherry-picked, gerrit just silently redoes the same action based on the latest target branch tip. And since it uses the same change-id, it will become Patch Set 2 in the existing patch instead of a new change.\n\nManually rebasing it by going to the cherry-pick change itself (instead of re-doing it) also works, but in that case it probably doesn\u0027t belong in the \u0027pick\u0027 command.",
